      <center><h1>Destiny</h1></center>
      <img src="files/Destiny.jpg">
      <p>Bungie has emphasized that the universe of Destiny will be "alive". Events may happen in-game that are not necessarily controlled or planned by the developer, which will help to create a dynamic developing experience for Bungie and a dynamic playing experience for gamers. The game's style has been described as an always-online first-person shooter that will incorporate massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements, but Bungie has avoided defining Destiny as a traditional MMO game. Instead, the game has been referred to as a "shared-world shooter," as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to see and interact with all other players in the game or on a particular server�as is the case in many conventional MMO games�Destiny will include on-the-fly matchmaking that will allow players to see and interact only with other players with whom they are "matched" by the game.</p><p>
Destiny will incorporate a new game engine that allows global illuminations and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together. An innovation in Bungie's "hopper" technology, which has been the backbone for Halo's matchmaking system, will allow better player matchmaking in order to create a more natural experience in either cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes.</p>

      <center><h1>Battle Ship 4</h1></center>
      <img src="files/Battle.jpg">
      <p>Just to be clear, this Battleship is not based on Milton Bradley�s beloved naval strategy game for children of all ages. It is, however, based on this summer's ridiculous-looking film starring CGI aliens and Rihanna that is very loosely inspired by the aforementioned kid�s classic, which explains why Battleship is primarily a first-person shooter and not, say, a strategy game.</p><p>

This videogame tie-in puts you in the role of Cole Mathis, a Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician who, when not defusing bombs, can command the entire naval fleet via his mobile Battle Command interface. After an alien force attacks the Hawaiian islands, you lead a battle on land � shooting invaders and destroying key targets � while also using a grid to orchestrate simplistic sea battles between the Navy�s battleships and enemy craft.</p>

      <p>The PlayStation 4 (officially abbreviated as PS4), is a video game console from Sony Computer Entertainment. Announced as the successor to PlayStation 3 during a press conference on February 20, 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, and November 29, 2013, in Europe and Australia. It competes with Nintendo's Wii U and Microsoft's Xbox One, as one of the eighth generation of video game consoles.
Moving away from the complicated Cell architecture of its predecessor, PlayStation 4 features a more elementary AMD processor, in hopes of attracting a broader range of developers and support for the system. Sony intends more focus on social gameplay, incorporating a "share" button on the new controller and enabling a view of in-game play streamed live from friends.</p><p>
The console enables interactivity with other services and devices through the following methods: Gaikai, a cloud-based gaming service that offers streaming video game content; PlayStation App, designed to enhance gameplay by using smartphones and tablets as a second screen; and PlayStation Vita's design for playing a majority of PlayStation 4 games through wireless Remote Play.</p><a class="gallery" href="Consolesgallery.html#ps4"><img src="files/showimage" class="showimage"></a><a class="top" href="#top" >Top</a>

      <p>Xbox One is a video game console developed and marketed by Microsoft. Announced on May 21, 2013, it is the successor to the Xbox 360 and is the third console in the Xbox family. It directly competes with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles. Xbox One was released across North America, several European markets, Australia, and New Zealand on November 22, 2013, and is scheduled for release in Japan and the remaining European markets in 2014. Microsoft and various publications have classified the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system", making it a competitor to other home media devices such as the Apple TV and the Google TV platforms.</p><p>
Moving away from the Xbox 360's PowerPC-based architecture and back into the x86 architecture used in the first Xbox, the console features an AMD processor built around the x86-64 instruction set. Xbox One places an increased emphasis on entertainment integration, offering the ability to overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box, split-screen multitasking of applications, and improved second screen support. The console includes a newly upgraded Kinect motion sensing peripheral, previously an optional attachment for the Xbox 360. Microsoft is emphasizing the Kinect's integration with Xbox One through features such as a built-in Skype client for videoconferencing, user recognition and tracking, and the ability to use voice commands and gestures to navigate the console's user interface. New gaming functionality will include an expanded Xbox Live service, improved Kinect functionality, cloud computing, the ability to automatically record and share video highlights from gameplay, and support for live streaming gameplay online.</p><a class="gallery" href="Consolesgallery.html#xone"><img src="files/showimage" class="showimage"></a><a class="top" href="#top" >Top</a>

      <p>The Xbox 360 is a video game console developed by and produced for Microsoft that was released in 2005. The successor to the original Xbox, it is the second console in the Xbox series. The Xbox 360 competes with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).</p><p>
As is typical of seventh-generation consoles, the Xbox 360 features an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and has received regular updates throughout the console's lifetime. The service is available in free and subscription-based varieties. In addition to offering online gaming, the service allows users to: download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, the Xbox 360 allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera.</p><a class="gallery" href="Consolesgallery.html#x360"><img src="files/showimage" class="showimage"></a><a class="top" href="#top" >Top</a>

      <p>After Valve announced both SteamOS and the Steam Machine gaming PCs earlier this week, most people logically believed that the company's final announcement for the week would end up being a controller. They were right. It's totally a controller.</p><p>

That said, I don't imagine most people were expecting the controller design we've been given. Titled the Steam Controller, this new device features a form and function that would be considered "nontraditional" by most modern gaming standards. Most notably, there are no analog sticks anywhere on the device. In their place are a pair of clickable trackpads, which Valve believes will offer a high fidelity input akin to a desktop mouse. For those who might lament the lack of physical interaction one would have in absence of actual sticks, Valve explains that it has included a new type of "haptic feedback" that...well, here, let's just read their explanation.</p><a class="gallery" href="Consolesgallery.html#steam"><img src="files/showimage" class="showimage"></a><a class="top" href="#top" >Top</a>

      <p>The PlayStation Vita (officially abbreviated PS Vita) is a handheld game console manufactured and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to the PlayStation Portable as part of the PlayStation brand of gaming devices. It was released in Japan and parts of Asia on December 17, 2011, in Europe, North America, South America and Singapore on February 22, 2012, and in Australia on February 23, 2012. It primarily competes with the Nintendo 3DS, as part of the eighth generation of gaming.</p><p>
The handheld includes two analog sticks, a 5-inch (130 mm) OLED multi-touch capacitive touchscreen, and supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and optional 3G. Internally, the Vita features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a quad-core SGX543MP graphics processing unit, as well as LiveArea software as its main user interface, which succeeds the XrossMediaBar.</p><p>
A redesigned PS Vita model, the PCH-2000 series, was released in Japan on October 10, 2013. The new system is 20% thinner, 15% lighter, has an additional hour of battery life, has moved from OLED to LCD, includes a universal standard USB port (micro USB), and 1GB of internal storage memory. The PlayStation Vita TV, which allows players to play PS Vita games on a television, was released in Japan on November 14, 2013.</p><a class="gallery" href="Consolesgallery.html#vita"><img src="files/showimage" class="showimage" style="height:24px;width:24px;float:none;margin-left:20px"></a><a class="top" href="#top" >Top</a>
